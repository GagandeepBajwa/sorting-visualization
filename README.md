Basic project to display different sorting algorithms

Built with ReactJs and deployed with Netlify.

Prototype Ideas: https://www.figma.com/file/o05JiwPUjKA4vOdWByfL67/Sorting-Visualizer?node-id=0%3A1

Major updates: I originally wanted to complete the project in Java and Swing (for GUI) but thinking a lot about it I've decided to switch to React so more people are able to access it without having to download the file, it is a visualizer after all.
